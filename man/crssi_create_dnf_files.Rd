\title{Create CRSS Natural Flow Input Files From Historical Record}
\usage{
crssi_create_dnf_files(
  iFile,
  oFolder,
  startYear,
  endYear,
  oFiles = nf_file_names(),
  recordToUse = NA,
  overwriteFiles = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{iFile}{Either the string `"CoRiverNF"``, or the relative or absolute
path to the excel workbook. When "CoRiverNF" is used, the data from the
\href{https://github.com/BoulderCodeHub/CoRiverNF}{CoRiverNF} data package is
used. Otherwise, it should be a valid path to the natural flow Excel
workbook.}

\item{oFolder}{Path to the top level directory where the trace folders and
input files will be created. This folder should exist before using this
function.}

\item{startYear}{The year to start the trace files in. Data will be trimmed
to start in this year.}

\item{endYear}{The final year of data the trace files will contain.}

\item{oFiles}{A matrix of the file names (input into CRSS). The default uses
\code{\link[=nf_file_names]{nf_file_names()}}. This must be specified in the correct
order, i.e., the same order as the nodes in the input Excel file.}

\item{recordToUse}{The start and end dates of the natural flow record to
perform ISM, if using something besides the full record. If it is \code{NA}, the
full record will be used. Otherwise, it should be a vector of length 2,
where the first entry is the start date and the second entry is the end
date. The vector should be of type \link[zoo:yearmon]{zoo::yearmon}, and begin in January of
some year, and end in December of some year.}

\item{overwriteFiles}{Boolean. Should existing files be overwritten.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{crssi} object.

\description{
\code{crssi_create_dnf_files()} creates the natural flow input files used by the
Colorado River Simulation System (CRSS) by applying the
\href{http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1752-1688.1997.tb03557.x/abstract}{Index Sequential Method}
(ISM) to the historical natural flow record (or a subset of the historical
record). \code{crssi_create_dnf_files()} is a convenience function that wraps
the process of getting/formatting data (\code{\link[=crss_nf]{crss_nf()}} + \code{\link[=sac_year_type_get]{sac_year_type_get()}} +
\code{\link[=crssi]{crssi()}}), applying ISM (\code{\link[=ism]{ism()}}), changing the dates to CRSS' future start
year (\code{\link[=reindex]{reindex()}}), and then writing out the files (\code{\link[=write_crssi]{write_crssi()}}).
}
\details{
\strong{Input Data:} The input data can be read from the natural flow workbook
available at
\url{http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g4000/NaturalFlow/current.html}
or from the \href{https://github.com/BoulderCodeHub/CoRiverNF}{CoRiverNF} data
package. It is much faster to use the data package rather than the Excel
workbook, and the files created from the two sources will match identically
if they are from the same natural flow release.

\strong{Other Files:} In addition to creating the natural flow input files, data
for two four other slots are also created. See \code{\link[=write_crssi]{write_crssi()}}.

\strong{Scenario Number:} The scenario number in \code{crssi} objects provides the user
with a numeric representation of which supply scenario is used.
The observed historical natural flows (used by this
function) are supply scenario 1. For this supply scenario, the decimals of
the supply scenario number represent the start and end year that the ISM
method are applied to. For example, if you set \code{recordToUse} to
\code{c('1988-1','2012-12')}, the decimal portion will be 19882012, where the
first 4 numbers represent the start year and the second four numbers
represent the end year. The supply scenario slot will be set to 1.19882012 in
this example. This tells the user of CRSS that the  supply scenario is the
observed historical natural flows with the ISM method applied to the
1988-2012 data.
