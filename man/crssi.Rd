\usage{
crssi(flow, sac_year_type, scen_number, scen_name = NULL, drop_flow = TRUE)

is_crssi(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{flow}{A \code{crss_nf} object.}

\item{sac_year_type}{An annual xts object with all time steps having a
December-some year time step. The number of columns in this object must
match the number of traces in \code{flow}. Additionally, there must be some
overlapping years of data. See details.}

\item{scen_number}{The scenario number. See \strong{Scenario Numbering Convention}
section.}

\item{scen_name}{Optional. This is only used when printing in R to help the
user quickly know what is stored in the \code{crssi} object.}

\item{drop_flow}{Boolean. If \code{TRUE}, and if \code{flow} contains flows other than
monthly, intervening, these flows will be dropped. This is suggested as
the memory needed to store the object and the time needed to apply ISM to
the object will be drastically reduced. If \code{FALSE}, the other flows are
kept in the object.}

\item{x}{An object.}
}
\value{
\code{crssi()} returns an object of class \code{crssi}.

\code{is_crssi()} returns \code{TRUE} if class inherits from \code{crssi}.
}
\description{
\code{crssi()} constructs a \code{crssi} object that holds all of the necessary
trace-based input data for CRSS. Namely, this includes the intervening,
monthly natural flow for all 29 sites, the Sacremento Year Type index,
and a scenario number.
}
\details{
\code{crssi()} inherits from \link{crss_nf}, maintaining the same required structure
for the intervening natural flows. The object also contains the Sacramento
Year Type index, and a scenario number. Given this, all functions that work
on \link{crss_nf} and \link{nfd} objects work on \code{crssi} objects.

\strong{Sacramento Year Type index:} Beginning in CRSS v2.6, input data for the
Sacramento year type index are necessary. For historical values see
\code{\link[=sac_year_type_get]{sac_year_type_get()}}.

Overlapping years: \code{crssi()} checks to make sure that there at least some
overlappying yeras of data between \code{flow} and \code{sac_year_type}. It then trims
the data to be January, year1 - December, year2 for the overlapping period
between \code{flow} and \code{sac_year_type}. For example, if \code{flow} contains data
for March 2020 - December 2024 while \code{sac_year_type} contains data for
December 2020 - December 2025, the returned object will contain monthly
intervening flow for January 2021 - December 2024, and Sacremento year type
index values for December 2021 - December 2024.

\section{Scenario Numbering Convention}{


Scenario numbering can change faster than this package. For the latest
numbering convention, check the package
\href{https://github.com/BoulderCodeHub/CRSSIO/wiki/Scenario-Numbering-Convention}{wiki}.

The numbering convention uses the following for the ones place of the
scenario number.
\itemize{
\item 1 = Observed Resampled, i.e., ISM applied to the historical record.
\item 2 = Direct Paleo Resampled
\item 3 = Paleo-conditioned
\item 4 = CMIP3 Downscaled GCM Projected-
\item 5 = CMIP5 Downscaled GCM Projected, BCSD downscaling, quantile mapping
secondary bias correction
}

Then, for scenarios that use the observed resampled data, the decimal portion
should be set to reflect the years that ISM is applied to. For example, if
you are using the 1988-2012 record, the decimal portion should be set to
19882012, where the first 4 numbers represent the start year and the second
four numbers represent the end year. Thus \code{scen_number} should be 1.19882012
in this example. This tells the user of CRSS that the supply scenario is
the observed historical natural flows with the ISM method applied to the
1988-2012 data.
